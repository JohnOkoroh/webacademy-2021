  <h1>Career: Realistic</h1>
  <p>When taking the career intrest profiler my top career was realistic. In that field of work you like to work with animals, tools, or machines. Generally avoids social activities like teaching, healing, and informing others. Has good skills in working with tools, mechanical or electrical drawings, machines, or plants and animals. Values practical things you can see, touch, and use like plants and animals, tools, equipment, or machines and sees self as practical, mechanical, and realistic.
    </p>
<br>
<p>Persons having a Realistic personality type "dominate" this environment. There are more of them than there are people of other personality types. For example, at a construction site there will be more persons having a "Realistic" personality than there will be people who have a Social or Artistic type. Realistic job preview is a tool companies and organizations use as a way to communicate the good and the bad characteristics of the job during the hiring process of new employees, or as a tool to reestablish job specificity for existing employees
  </p>
<br>
<p>"Realistic" people create a "Realistic" environment. For example, they particularly value people who are practical and mechanical -- who are good at working with tools, mechanical or electrical drawings, machines, or animals.Some realistic job examples are Floor Sanders and Finishers, Terrazzo Workers and Finishers, Stonemasons and many more.</p>
